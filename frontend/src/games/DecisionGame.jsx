/**
 * DecisionGame — vertical pitch, attacking UPWARD toward the goal at the top.
 *
 * Coordinate convention:
 *   x in [0, 1]  — left → right
 *   y in [0, 1]  — TOP (goal we're attacking) → BOTTOM (own half)
 *
 * Defenders sit between attackers and the top goal (small y).
 * Attackers run UP (decreasing y) toward goal.
 *
 * Offside line is drawn as a horizontal red dashed line at the y-coordinate of
 * the second-last opposition player — i.e. the deepest outfield defender
 * (excluding the keeper, who is closest to y=0). Attackers must be at y >= the
 * offside line at the moment the ball is played to be onside.
 *
 * Props: onComplete({ score, total, avgTime, decisions })
 *
 * Scenarios are strictly advisory — each option carries a reason, and one option
 * is flagged with `recommended: true` (the coach's preferred call). The game
 * never labels a user's pick as "correct" or "wrong".
